Benchmarks
==========

This section contains the description of selected `benchmarks 
<http://hpfem.org/git/gitweb.cgi/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/benchmarks>`_.
Contrary to regular examples, benchmarks typically come with 
a known exact solution and thus they are a great resource for 
comparisons of various methods and adaptivity algorithms.
