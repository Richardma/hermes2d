Welcome to Hermes 2D.

Documentation
=============

Hermes2D manual is contained in the directory 'doc/'.

Developer documentation can be compiled by running 'doxygen' in 'src/'.


Compilation
===========

If you are using a Debian-based system, install the required libraries first:

$ apt-get install cmake g++ libjudy-dev freeglut3-dev libsuitesparse-dev

(Note: cmake has to be at least version 2.6 or later)

If you want to use Python, install also:

$ apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-scipy cython

Configure:

$ cmake .

Build:

$ make

If you have more than one CPU, you can use "make -j N" where N is
the number of CPUs of your computer.

More options
------------

You can turn on and off various components to build, just create the CMake.vars
file and add the following:

set(WITH_EXAMPLES NO)
set(WITH_PYTHON YES)

(and any other option that you would like to change, see CMakeLists.txt for the
whole list).

If you are on OS X, you have to disable GLUT as the glut library is not easily
installable on OS X. To do so, just put the following line into your
CMake.vars:

set(WITH_GLUT NO)

Install hermes
--------------

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/lib .
make
make install
