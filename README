Welcome to Hermes 2D.

Documentation
=============

Hermes2D manual is contained in the directory 'doc/'.

Developer documentation can be compiled by running 'doxygen' in 'src/'.


Compilation
===========

If you are using a Debian-based system, install the required libraries first:

$ apt-get install cmake g++ libjudy-dev freeglut3-dev libsuitesparse-dev

If you want to use Python, install also:

$ apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-scipy cython

Configure:

$ cmake .

Build:

$ make

If you have more than one CPU, you can use "make -j N" where N is
the number of CPUs of your computer.

More options
------------

You can turn on and off various components to build, just create the CMake.vars
file and add the following:

set(WITH_EXAMPLES NO)
set(WITH_PYTHON YES)

(and any other option that you would like to change, see CMakeLists.txt for the
whole list).
