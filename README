Welcome to Hermes 2D.

Documentation
=============

Hermes2D manual is contained in the directory 'doc/'.

Developer documentation can be compiled by running 'doxygen' in 'src/'.


Compilation
===========

If you are using a Debian-based system, install the required libraries first:

$ apt-get install cmake g++ libjudy-dev freeglut3-dev libsuitesparse-dev

(Note: cmake has to be at least version 2.6 or later)

If you want to use Python, install also:

$ apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-scipy cython matplotlib

(matplotlib has to be at least 0.98.5.2 or higher)

Configure:

$ cmake .

Build:

$ make

If you have more than one CPU, you can use "make -j N" where N is
the number of CPUs of your computer.

More options
------------

You can turn on and off various components to build, just create the CMake.vars
file and add the following:

set(WITH_EXAMPLES NO)
set(WITH_PYTHON YES)

(and any other option that you would like to change, see CMakeLists.txt for the
whole list).

You can also easily generate it from a script (e.g. a debian/rules file) by:

/bin/echo -e "set(COMPLEX no)\nset(WITH_EXAMPLES no)\nset(WITH_PYTHON yes)\nset(WITH_GLUT no)\nset(WITH_UTIL no)" > CMake.vars

or (some systems don't support "echo -e"):

python -c 'print "set(COMPLEX no)\nset(WITH_EXAMPLES no)\nset(WITH_PYTHON yes)\nset(WITH_GLUT no)\nset(WITH_UTIL no)"' > CMake.vars

If you are on OS X, you have to disable GLUT as the glut library is not easily
installable on OS X. To do so, just put the following line into your
CMake.vars:

set(WITH_GLUT NO)


For development, it is good to say (in global CMake.vars):

	set(DEBUG YES) to compile debug versions
	set(RELEASE YES) to compile release versions

Then type:

$ make debug    (to build debug versions)
$ make release  (to build release versions)


Install hermes
--------------
