$ apt-get install python-dev python-numpy python-scipy cython

Configure:

$ cmake .

Build:

$ make

If you have more than one CPU, you can use "make -j N" where N is
the number of CPUs of your computer.

More options

You can turn on and off various components to build, some examples:

cmake -DWITH_PYTHON=yes -DWITH_UMFPACK=yes -DWITH_EXAMPLES=yes .

Alternatively, create CMake.vars and set the variables in there:

set(WITH_UMFPACK YES)
set(WITH_EXAMPLES YES)
